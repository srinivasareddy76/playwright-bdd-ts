# This directory is for storing client certificates and other secrets
# 
# IMPORTANT: Never commit actual certificate files (.pfx, .p12, .key, .pem) to version control
# 
# Place your client certificates here:
# - client.pfx (or environment-specific names like t5-client.pfx)
# - Set the passphrase in your .env file as PFX_PASSPHRASE
# 
# Example structure:
# secrets/
#   ├── .gitkeep (this file)
#   ├── t5-client.pfx
#   ├── u1-client.pfx
#   └── qd1-client.pfx
#
# The .gitignore file ensures these certificates are never committed.
